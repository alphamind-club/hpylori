Zhang, S. and Chen, J. Y. 2023. In Silico Design of Helicobacter pylori for Targeted Cancer Therapy. (pending review)

# ABSTRACT
This study innovatively explores the use of the 26695 Helicobacter pylori strain, typically associated with gastric cancer, as a potential vector for bacterial-mediated cancer therapy (BMCT). By leveraging H. pylori's unique ability to withstand and navigate the harsh gastric environment and the tumor microenvironment (TME), we open up new possibilities for targeted anticancer drug delivery. The research also addresses potential pathogenic risks and genetic complications of H. pylori, suggesting possible genetic modifications to both mitigate these hazards and enhance the bacterium's anti-cancer capabilities. By aligning key proteins in H. pylori with gastric cancer's unique challenges for drug delivery and treatment, we outline a novel blueprint for advancing BMCT in the fight against gastroenterological cancers. This work was made possible through the support of xxx High School and the AlphaMind Club.

# METHODS
The sequencing data used in this study was extracted from Tomb et al. [1] and analyzed using Geneious Prime, a comprehensive bioinformatics software platform. The initial sequence dataset contained 1,632 identified genes across 3,241 genomic regions.
To refine the data for further analysis, we employed a two-step filtering process. First, we removed any coding regions classified as speculative, as these may not accurately represent functional gene products.   This was achieved by cross-referencing the Geneious Prime annotations with the GenBank database to ensure that only well-annotated and experimentally confirmed genes were included subsequently.
Next, we manually assessed the remaining genes for their relevance to three key areas: environmental resistance, colonization capacity, and toxicity. This assessment was based on the biological function of the encoded proteins as documented in the available literature and existing genomic databases. Each gene was scrutinized for any direct or indirect role it might play in these areas, thereby yielding a refined list of candidate genes.
The manual evaluation process was guided in part by the methodologies and findings of Doig et al. [2]. Furthermore, we utilized summaries generated by ChatGPT to augment our understanding and evaluation of the relevant genes. This innovative approach provided an additional layer of analysis, ensuring comprehensive consideration of the data.
In parallel to the gene categorization process, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of over 100 scientific works related to protein function in H. pylori. This review aided in associating identified genes with their potential roles in H. pylori's survival and pathogenicity.
The resultant categorization of genes, along with their associated references, is available as a supplemental file on our GitHub repository (https://github.com/alphamind-club/hpylori). We believe this file will serve as a valuable resource for future investigations into H. pylori's genomic characteristics and their implications for its pathogenicity and environmental adaptability.
